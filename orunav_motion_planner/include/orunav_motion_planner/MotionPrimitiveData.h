/**
 * @class MotionPrimitiveData
 * Encodes a single motion primitive. The motion primitive is mainly characterized by a path,
 * in which each pose is encoded by a vehicleSimplePoint (x,y,orientation,steering).
 * The vehicleSimplePoint encodes the information in meters and radians with the initial
 * (x,y) position of the path being typically (0,0).
 * The class stores also additional information, such as the IDs of the steering and orientation
 * angles both at the beginning and at the end of the path, the primitive ID, the offsets (in cells)
 * of the motion, the overall distance covered, the cost multiplier associated with this primitive,
 * the direction of the motion and the cells swept by the vehicle during the motion.
